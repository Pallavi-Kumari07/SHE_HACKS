To access the website, first the system must have Xampp downloaded beforehand. Once it is available,
create a database in it named "she_hacks" by doing manually or by using query "CREATE DATABASE she_hacks;".
Now, put the following link on browser : 

http://localhost/SHE_HACKS/database/createTables.php    (i)     //Define path correctly
Make sure the directory you're working in is located inside the home/..../xampp/htdocs/ folder.
Define the path in the link (i) correctly before running it in browser.
After this, the database will get updated. (Go to your xampp for verification.)

////////
To escape all the hassle, simply create a folder named "SHE_HACKS" in xampp/htdocs/ directory and
bring all the files from GitHub here.
To verify check if your path to the file "main.php" is like " ....xampp/htdocs/SHE_HACKS/main.php "
///////


Now, run the link (ii) in browser :

http://localhost/SHE_HACKS/main.php (ii)    //Define path correctly
